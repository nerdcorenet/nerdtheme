GNOME Shell:
gnome-shell styles may be overridden in the file
  ~/.themes/mytheme/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css
All styles are inherited except those overridden in this file.
In order to enable a custom gnome-shell theme, install packages
  gnome-shell-extensions gnome-twek-tool
then use the Tweak Tool to enable your custom GNOME Shell theme.
- Launch the “Tweaks” app from the application launcher and go to the “Extensions” tab in the sidebar. Enable the “User Themes” extension, as shown in the screenshot below. Be sure that the “Extensions” toggle is enabled at the top.

GTK:
In order to style the window dressings in GNOME, you must create a
custom GTK+ Theme in the file
  ~/.themes/mytheme/gtk-3.0/gtk.css
This file provides all style information for the theme; styles are NOT
inherited from previous themes.
In order to identify the correct CSS Selector to target, use the
GTK Inspector application:
  $ gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true
  $ GTK_DEBUG=interactive gnome-application-name

FireFox:
See https://superuser.com/a/1669549
First identify the Profile Path for your FF installation by entering this URL:
  about:settings
Search for "Profile Path" and go there in the filesystem. Create a new file
  $profile_path/chrome/userChrome.css
Put this line at the top of the file:
  @namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");
Enable customizations from this file:
  about:config
  toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = True
In order to identify the correct CSS Selector to target,
enable chrome debugging and remote debugging:
  F12
  F1
  Advanced Preferences:
  - Chrome Debugging = Enabled
  - Remote Debugging = Enabled
  Menubar => Tools => Browser Tools => Browser Toolbox
